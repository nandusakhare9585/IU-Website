              a vibrant university with over 16,000 students from across India, engaged in multi-disciplinary graduate,

              Indira University emerges from a prosperous heritage, under the visionary leadership of Dr. Tarita
              Shankar. With a steadfast commitment to providing the best pedagogy, we offer a diverse range of programs
              in Business, Commerce & Economics, Liberal Arts, Information Technology, Pharmacy, and Doctoral Studies.
              Dr. Tarita Shankar's foresight recognized the need for an education that empowers individuals and fuels
              India's economic growth. As the nation navigated a challenging period, she envisioned an educational
              landscape that was both broad-based and vocational. This pioneering spirit in 1994 ignited a saga of
              academic excellence that continues to reach its zenith.
