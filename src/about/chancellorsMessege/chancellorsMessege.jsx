              Foreseeing Indias economic transformation in the early 1990s, Dr.
              Tarita Shankar championed a dynamic and vocational education
              model. Inspired by the wisdom of Chanakya and the legacy of Prime
              Minister Indira Gandhi, she envisioned an institution empowering
              students to thrive in the global arena. This visionary spirit led
              to the birth of the Shree Chanakya Education Society, the
              foundation of Indira Universitys success story.
